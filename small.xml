   John Blair &amp; Co. is close to an agreement to sell its TV station advertising representation operation and program production unit to an investor group led by James H. Rosenfield, a former CBS Inc. executive, industry sources said. 

   Industry sources put the value of the proposed acquisition at more than $100 million. 
John Blair was acquired last year by Reliance Capital Group Inc., which has been divesting itself of John Blair's major assets. 
John Blair represents about 130 local television stations in the placement of national and other advertising. 

   Mr. Rosenfield stepped down as a senior executive vice president of CBS Broadcasting in December 1985 under a CBS early retirement program. 
Neither Mr. Rosenfield nor officials of John Blair could be reached for comment.

   Canadian manufacturers' new orders fell to $20.80 billion (Canadian) in January, down 4% from December's $21.67 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said. 

   The decrease followed a 4.5% increase in December. 

   Manufacturers' shipments followed the same trend, falling 1.5% in January to $21.08 billion, after a 2.8% increase the previous month. 
The agency said there is "some indication of an upturn" in the recent irregular pattern of shipments, following the generally downward trend recorded during the first half of 1986.

   The chairman's son has left Winnebago Industries Inc. to strike out on his own -- again. 

   The Forest City, Iowa, maker of motor homes said John V. Hanson, 47, resigned as deputy chairman and a director to "pursue other business interests." 

   That puts new life into the guessing on who will succeed founder and chairman John K. Hanson, who is 76 years old and controls about 45% of the company's stock. 
Winnebago watchers have speculated for the past few years about what would happen to that holding -- and the company -- when he is no longer around. 

   "The old man refuses to admit that could happen," says Frank P. Rolfes, an analyst who follows the company for Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis. 

   In an interview last fall, the chairman noted that his mother was 102 years old, and added, "I think I can keep up with what's his name at Occidental Petroleum." (What's his name is Armand Hammer, Occidental's 91-year-old chairman). 

   Mr. Rolfes and other followers of the company believe that Winnebago could become the target of one or more raiders after John K. Hanson is no longer in control. 
Neither John K. nor John V. Hanson could be reached for comment, and a Winnebago spokesman didn't return phone calls. 

   John V.'s first tour with the company lasted from the 1960s to 1979, and included a two-year stint as chief executive. 
The company ousted him from that post in 1977 in favor of an outsider. 
"My father ran that company whenever it suited his fancy," the younger Hanson complained in an interview after he left the company the first time. 

   In his second tour, he was named a director in 1985 and deputy chairman a year later. 
But analysts and former company officials say the jobs didn't carry much responsibility. 
When Winnebago named a seven-member management council to run the company last year, the younger Mr. Hanson wasn't included. 

   John K. Hanson, the chairman, isn't inclined to tip his hand on his successor. 
When asked in the interview last fall if John V. was a candidate, he replied, "Some people think his younger brother" will run the company some day. 

   The younger brother is Paul Hanson, who remains at Winnebago, where he has advised the company on investments for its portfolio. 
He made headlines earlier this year after suing his bank trustee and lawyer for allowing him to spend and lose his personal $4 million fortune in less than five years. 

   Succeeding John V. as deputy chairman is Richard D. Conner, chief executive of Winnebago's Cycle Sat unit, which distributes television commercials to TV stations by satellite. 

   Fred G. Dhormann, Winnebago's vice president, corporate real estate, was named to succeed John V. as a director.

deals will increase John Hancock Mutual Funds' assets under
management to $4.1 billion from $3 billion at the beginning
